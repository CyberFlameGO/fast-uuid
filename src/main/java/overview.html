        <p><a href="https://github.com/jchambers/fast-uuid" target="_top">fast-uuid</a> is a Java library for quickly and efficiently parsing and writing UUIDs. It yields the most dramatic performance gains when compared to Java 8 and older; in benchmarks, it's a little more than fourteen times faster at parsing UUIDs and six times faster at writing UUIDs than the stock JDK implementation. Compared to Java 9 and newer, it's about six times faster when it comes to parsing UUIDs and offers no benefits for writing UUIDs.

        <p>This library is intended for applications that work with large quantities of UUIDs or that work with UUIDs in performance-sensitive code, and probably won't be helpful in applications that work with UUIDs infrequently.</p>
